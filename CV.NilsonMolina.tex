	% ===== Professional Summary =====
	\section*{Professional Summary}
	Software engineer with a strong backend focus and experience working on production systems at different stages of maturity. Most of my work has been around Laravel-based platforms, where I’ve handled data-intensive systems, APIs consumed by mobile applications, and internal tools supporting operational workflows. I usually work close to system boundaries, making pragmatic technical decisions around data quality, performance, reliability, and API contracts. Over time, my responsibilities have naturally grown from guided execution to full technical ownership in individual contributor roles.
