	Dear Hiring Team at Monks,

	I am applying for the Senior Back End Developer position focused on Node.js. I have been working on backend systems for several years, mostly in environments where the main goal was to keep platforms stable, understandable, and working reliably in production.

	A large part of my experience comes from maintaining and improving existing systems rather than building everything from scratch. In practice, that usually meant dealing with production issues, reviewing code written by different developers over time, and fixing performance problems that affected day-to-day operations. I have spent a lot of time refactoring backend code, adjusting data access patterns, and simplifying services that had become hard to maintain.

	I have worked with Node.js and PHP to build and maintain backend services used by web and mobile applications. Many of these systems required integrating multiple platforms and keeping data consistent across them. Most of my database work has been with PostgreSQL, but my focus has always been on how data is accessed and used, not on a specific technology. I have also worked with applications deployed on AWS, mainly contributing at the application level rather than managing infrastructure directly.

	I am used to working closely with frontend developers and product teams, especially when defining API behavior, adjusting responses, or debugging issues that cross system boundaries. Code reviews, production debugging, and small but continuous improvements have been a regular part of my work.

	I am looking for a backend role where there is real responsibility over the system, and where technical decisions are taken seriously because they affect real users and teams. From what I have read, this role at Monks seems aligned with that type of work.

	Thank you for your time and consideration.

	Kind regards,

	Nilson Aldair Molina Rengifo
